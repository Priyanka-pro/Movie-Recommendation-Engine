# Problem Statement
Perform analysis and Basic Recommendations based on Similar Genres and Movies which Users prefer.
Some of the Key Points on which I will be focusing include:
● Profitability of Movies
● Language based Gross Analysis
● Comparison of Gross and Profit for Different Genres,
● Recommendation systems based on Actors, Movies, Genres.
This Project help me to understand Correlation between these factors

# Calculating Profit of a Movie
● Budget: It is an amount which Producers Spend to Produce a Movie which Includes the Production, casting, and Advertisements cost.
● Gross: It is an amount which Producers earn by releasing their movies in theaters, selling satellite rights to TV, OTT Platforms such as Prime, Hulu,Disney+Hotstar, Netflix etc.
● Profit: Gross - Budget, 
We are going to use this formula, to calculate Top Most Profitable Movies of all time.

# Calculating Social Media Popularity
Important Factors to determine the Social Media Popularity includes:
● Number of People who voted for the Movie.
● Number of People who Reviewed the Movie.
● Number of Facebook Likes on the Movie Page.
Using these Metrics, we have come up with a Formula to calculate the Social Media Popularity of these Movies.
  # *(No. of People Reviewed for Movie/No. Of People Voted for Movie)*No. Of Facebook Likes
